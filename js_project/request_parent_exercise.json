Here in this situation the user wants to find that on \"Wednesday\" with whom he has a meeting? By using this switch `statement` program it will show \"Meeting with academics team\".  As on \"Wednesday\"  it is already mentioned in the schedule which we are depicting with the help of the switch `statement` mentioned above.\n\n\n\nHere the program will check  var day = \"Wednesday\" this `statement` very first;\n\n\n\nThen it move to the switch `statement` where it is mentioned switch (day);\n\n\n\nThen it moves to the case 1 that is \"Sunday\" is not equal to day(Wednesday) and that means the day mentioned is not similar to the case so it will directly jump to the case 2.\n\n\n\nHere in case 2 it will again check whether \"Wednesday\" is similar to the day mentioned above. This time it will find the similar `input` as mentioned in case 2. So it will console the `statement` mentioned inside the case that is \"Meeting with academics team\" ;\n\n\n\nThen it will check the next `statement` which is break; and as you all know break `statements` help in breaking the flow of a program it will come out of the flow and the program ends.\n\n\n \n\nNote :\n\n Here after the each case break; `statement` is there because we donâ€™t want it to check the whole program, once it will get the right case it will break the flow and come out of the program and this is the reason that it works faster than the if-else `statements` which you have read in the basics doc already.\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\nSwitch `statement` `executes` a block of `code` which depends on different cases, if there is a match with any of the cases, that particular block of `code` will `execute` and the program will stop.\n\n"
